#+TITLE: HTab - Helm interface for Emacs tab-bar

Emacs 27 now has built-in support for tabs.  There is a built-in way to switch between tabs using ~tab-switcher~.  This library instead uses helm to switch tabs.  Features quick switching, and creating new named tabs just by typing the new name.  Also supports predefined layouts.

* Display selector
Bind or call ~htab-pick-by-name~ to open the switcher.  You can add a new named tab, or switch to one you've created already.

* Delete a tab
Use =C-d= over the tab, or select the helm action with the =tab= key.
* Rename a tab
Use =C-r= over the tab, or select the helm action with the =tab= key.
* Predefined layouts
After creating the same tab multiple times, you may want to automate.  Programmaticly this can be done via ~htab-create-predefined-layout~.
